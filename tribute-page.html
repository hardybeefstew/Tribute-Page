          <h3 class="text-center"><font="5px">The first page of the first issue of <em>A Testimony and a Witness</em> offers a look into what mattered most to T. Austin-Sparks:
            <br>
            <blockquote><em>	The object of the ministry of this little paper, issued bi-monthly, is to contribute to the Divine end which is presented in the words of Ephesians 4:13 - "...till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge (literally - full knowledge) of the Son of God, unto a full-grown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we be no longer children..."
              <br>
              <br>
        It is not connected with any 'Movement,' 'Organization,' 'Mission' or separate body of Christians, but is just a ministry to "all saints." Its going forth is with the prayer and hope that it will so result in a fuller measure of Christ, a richer and higher level of spiritual life, that, while bringing the Church of God into a growing approximation to His revealed will as to its 'attainment,' the Church may be better qualified to be used of Him in testimony in the nations, and to the completing of its own number by the salvation of those yet to be added by the Lord.</em></blockquote>
